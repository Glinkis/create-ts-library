A modular javascript utility library.

[Documentation](https://glinkis.github.io/jslib/)

## Installation
```bash
npm install jslib-utils --save
```

## Usage
Please observe that this library requires you to be able to use import/export.

The library is structured in such a way that it's possible to import any module separately.
A few examples would be:
```js
import * as jslibUtils from "jslib-utils"
```
```js
import * as math from "jslib-utils/src/math"
```
```js
import { clamp } from "jslib-utils/src/math/clamp"
```

Please feel free to contribute.
