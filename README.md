A modular javascript utility library.

[Documentation](https://glinkis.github.io/jslib/)

## Installation

```bash
npm install jslib-utils --save
```

## Usage

The library is built to allow for tree shaking (the elimination of unused code).

To access the modules, import through either `jslib-utils/lib`(commonjs modules)
or `jslib-utils/es`(es2015 modules).

There is also a minimized version available through
`jslib-utils/dist/jslib-utils.min` if you prefer that.

### Tree Shaking

Imports the whole library, and doesn't allow for tree shaking.

```js
import * as jslibUtils from "jslib-utils/dist/jslib-utils.min";
import * as jslibUtils from "jslib-utils/lib";
import * as jslibUtils from "jslib-utils/es";
```

Imports only the relevant modules, and thus allows for tree shaking. Keep in
mind that importing a whole module won't strip any unused functions inside of
that particular module.

```js
import { array, math } from "jslib-utils/lib";
import { array, math } from "jslib-utils/es";
```

Imports can have any level of granularity, and so importing only the specific
functions you need will allow for the the greatest amount of code elimination..

```js
import { easing } from "jslib-utils/lib/animation";
import { linear } from "jslib-utils/lib/animation/easing";
```
